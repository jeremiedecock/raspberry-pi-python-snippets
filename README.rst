EDA
~~~

- Fritzing (http://fritzing.org/): create PCB layouts and diagrams
- Autodesk Circuits (https://circuits.io/): an online EDA
  - Main advantage over Fritzing: it can simulate an Arduino with a given
    source code (see this `link
    <http://hackaday.com/2013/09/11/123d-circuits-autodesks-free-design-tool/>`__)
- Upverter (https://upverter.com/): an online EDA
- Meowcad (https://meowcad.com/): an online EDA

PCB production services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fritzing Fab (https://go.aisler.net/fritzing): produce PCBs out of Fritzing sketches
- Autodesk Circuits (https://circuits.io/): produce PCBs designed on https://circuits.io/
